I opened a dispute with Citi and let them know I have video of the gross negligence and almost malicious treatment of my property.  They never contacted me, never asked for the video and denied the dispute saying there was no proof.  I have offered to share the link so they can see the video, they say they cannot view the video.

I always call my credit credit card company and give them my travel plans as I often travel for 6 months or more to multiple countries.  I did this for a trip we are on in the Arctic.  Since we have been in Norway I have had to call 3 times to try to clear Fraud alerts raised by Citibank in the country where they know I am traveling.  Needless to say, this is very frustrating.  We put new SIM cards in our phones and have Norwegian numbers at the moment. They cannot contact us via SMS as they won't send them internationally.  After waiting on hold 25 minutes, I just finished verifying15-20 transactions where they were approved at the POS but Citibank put them on fraud alert.  One was for $1.43.  I can't do this every week I am gone.  If this happens again, Amex it is for the rest of the trip."

So just went to find out why my partners BOQ Visa didn't work and tried to do a small transaction (so thought I would do a gold lotto, never usually play it) and my card was stopped. Thought there was an issue but when I got through to the BOQ provider (who I thought had changed to NAB) but was still Citibank they said ANY transactions for gambling are blocked by Citi. Right???? So what right do they have to stop any transaction on any moral grounds considering they are a credit card provider helping to facilitate debt and misery for millions of people. I tried this with another banks card and it worked. I guess the issue is what a slippery slope we have put ourselves on relying on cards as a provider can just stop you from transacting what they like really... If I had a gambling issue and had asked them to not allow me to use my card on a legitimate website then that would be fine. If I am an adult and want to use my card on ANY website that accepts it why can I not. No wonder your share price is dipping and customers are leaving with outdated apps, systems and also finding out that Citi are the moral compass of the bank. :-("
